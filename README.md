# pageRank-prado
In this project, developed for the course Algorithms for Massive Data, two variations of the PageRank algorithm, unweighted and weighted edges, were applied to a dataset of paintings from the Prado Museum. The goal was to rank the paintings based on their relationships, where connections were defined by shared tags between artworks. Each painting was considered as a node in a graph, and edges between these were formed based on the shared tags. The unweighted PageRank algorithm treated all connections equally, while the weighted PageRank variation assigned more importance to links with more common tags, providing a nuanced ranking system. The implementation utilized PySparkâ€™s distributed computing capabilities to efficiently handle the large dataset and create scalable solutions.
